        <p>As Australia’s largest city, Sydney is often the first stop for travellers taking a trip down-under. With a unique blend of impressive skyline, picturesque harbour, iconic architecture and stretches of golden beaches, it’s no wonder that Sydney’s been hailed as one of the world’s most beautiful cities. A vibrant destination that is both buzzing with high energy and effortlessly chilled out, you’ll have an unforgettable time discovering the different sides of the city. So if this is your first time in Sydney, check out these must-do activities to get your trip started!</p>
        <br>
        <p>Being home to some of the most loved (and feared) creatures, Australia’s wildlife is certainly unique to the rest of the world. If you’re looking to get up close and personal to some of these native animals, then just a short walk from Darling Harbour is the Sydney Wildlife Zoo where you can enjoy the Australian outback in the heart of the city. Here, you’ll have the unforgettable opportunity to cuddle koalas, hand feed kangaroos and come face to face with Tasmanian devils whilst learning about their habits from informative and passionate staff. If you dare, step into the Nightfall Habitat and discover some of the weird and wonderful creatures that only come out after dark or explore the Gum Tree Valley habitat and meet two of the world’s deadliest snakes.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Also situated by Darling Harbour is the Sydney Sealife Aquarium where you can immerse yourself in the magical world under the sea and discover the wonder of The Great Barrier Reef. You’ll be sure to find something that captivates you whilst walking through these fascinating marine exhibits, from immense tanks of kaleidoscopic tropical fish to neon jellyfish pools. One of the must-see highlights are the long transparent tunnels where huge reef sharks and sting rays swim right overhead! The aquarium is also a fantastic place for families, and kids can enjoy a hands on learning experience in the touch rock pools and even feel live starfish.</p>
