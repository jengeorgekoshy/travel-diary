        <p>For anyone with a passion for history or adventure, a visit to Cairo is a definite bucket-list item. Home to one of the seven wonders of the world—the Pyramids of Giza—the Egyptian capital features stunning beaches, vibrant marketplaces, and an entertaining nightlife. But if you’re visiting for the first time, the city can be quite overwhelming, so here are seven things to know before you arrive.</p>
        <br>
        <p>You’ll need to put some thought into what you pack for a trip to Egypt for reasons relating to both climate and culture. The best way to get by is by layering—not only because the desert can become quite chilly at night, but also because it will help you keep covered from the sting of the sun during the day(light-coloured, breathable fabrics work best). Women will also need long sleeves and scarves to cover their arms and head if they plan to visit mosques. The other thing to pack plenty of? Socks—all Islamic sites forbid the wearing of shoes, and going barefoot is frowned upon (and kind of gross).</p>
